        <h1>Sunny or Clear</h1>
        <p>
          A sunny day, or clear sky during nighttime, is when there are clouds
          above the horizon. If one is at the top of a mountain or travel in a
          plane, possible clouds and fogs don't count as long as they remain
          below the horizon level. This also means that the sky is always
          sunny/clear above the highest altitude at which clouds can generate,
          which is about 85,340 meters (53 miles). Sunny days are bought by
          anticyclones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sunny weather can help temperatures to rise under the Sun's influence
          but a clear sky during the night allows temperatures to significantly
          drop, especially in winter, as heat is radiating from the surroundings
          and there is no cloud cover to keep it from escaping to space; the
          decrease in temperature keeps going until an hour after sunrise. Thus,
          sunny weather causes the most important variations in temperatures
          within the same air mass.

      <div className="Partially-cloudy">
        <h1>Partially cloudy</h1>
        <p>
          Partially cloudy weather is when some clouds are hovering above the
          horizon level; however, most of the sky remains clear and there is no
          precipitation of any kind. The clouds may temporarily drop the
          temperature when they hide the Sun during the day, which is
          particularly helpful during a heatwave.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="Cloudy">
        <h1>Cloudy</h1>
        <p>
          Cloudy weather is when a significant amount of clouds is covering the
          sky (at least half the sky). A cloudy day may result in some weak
          showers, snowfalls, or even thunderstorms, although a thunderstorm
          temporarily overcasts the sky as it happens.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="Overcast">
        <h1>Overcast</h1>
        <p>
          Overcast weather is when the sky is completely covered by a cloud
          blanket. Days are significantly dimmer and nights are completely dark
          without artificial sources of light. If cirrus or cirrostratus are
          covering the sky, the Sun or Moon may remain visible, and daytime is
          slightly brighter than with a stratus cover; however, the latter is
          far more common than the former. Depending on the type of clouds and
          time of the day, an overcast sky may appear white, light grey, grey,
          or dark blue during sunrises/sunsets.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="rain">
        <h1>Rain</h1>
        <p>
          Rain is the condensed moisture of the atmosphere above falling under
          the form of liquid droplets. It is an extremely important phenomenon
          that allows life to flourish on continents; without regular rains, the
          land turns into a hot desert. However, strong rains can also cause
          catastrophic floods, capable of destroying areas as large as an entire
          metropolis. In addition, rain causes other side effects such as
          slippery roads, longer braking distances, decreased visibility
          (pseudo-fog)... Episodic rains that last only a few minutes are called
          showers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rain intensity is often measured in millimeters (or inches); an mm of
          rain corresponds to a liter of water over a square meter. Typical
          rains give less than 5 mm (0.1 in) per hour; however, there are also
          torrential rains that can give way more than a hundred millimeters (4
          in) per hour; the record of rain amount in an hour is 305 mm (12 in)!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="Drizzle">
        <h1>Drizzle</h1>
        <p>
          Drizzle is similar to rain, but the droplets are very small and hardly
          noticeable with the naked eye. Drizzles are always weak, but they also
          limit visibility. Drizzle may precede or turns into a fog.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="fog">
        <h1>Fog</h1>
        <p>
          Fog is literally a cloud at ground level, which raises ambient
          humidity to its maximum, and considerably decreases visibility. The
          threshold of visibility at which we talk of fog is a kilometer (0.6
          miles), but some fogs can decrease visibility up to 20 meters (65.6
          foot). If visibility is greater than 1 km (0.6 miles), we talk of a
          mist. Fogs can happen anywhere, even in deserts, but happen more
          frequently in cold, humid climates. Depending on the moment of the
          day, they sport various shades of grey, varying from light grey at
          solar noon, to dark grey at the sunset.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="Tornados">
        <h1>Tornados</h1>
        <p>
          Tornadoes are rotating air columns spinning at a very high speed. They
          are born under supercell thunderstorms, which are a specific kind of
          cumulonimbus that is spinning on itself. Tornadoes act as a sort of
          “natural vacuum cleaner”, aspiring then projecting everything it can
          take on its path. Tornadoes swallow dust and debris that make them
          visible the day and, depending on the materials swallowed, make them
          light grey, grey, or even brown. The night, tornadoes are normally
          invisible making them much more dangerous and threatening, but
          lightning can reveal their existence and position. Tornadoes make also
          a lot of sounds, especially the strongest ones, which can help
          identify them with little to no visibility.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="Stormy">
        <h1>Stormy</h1>
        <p>
          A thunderstorm is a type of weather characterized by lightning. There
          are produced by the largest and tallest clouds that can spawn, the
          cumulonimbus. Thunderstorms are also accompanied by strong gusts of
          wind, heavy rainfalls, and sometimes hail and tornadoes, which are the
          most destructive meteorological event. A thunderstorm, regardless of
          its intensity, is always a dangerous phenomenon that should be taken
          seriously as lightning can cause great bodily harm, and sometimes even
          kill, anyone unfortunate enough to be hit with.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="standstorms">
        <h1>Standstorms</h1>
        <p>
          Sandstorms are large surges of sand and dust carried away by strong
          winds, which take the form of a dull brown wall seen from far away.
          Sandstorms are normally not lethal but the amount of sand makes any
          outdoor activity very difficult, and breathing may become unbearable
          with the number of particles in the air. Sandstorms usually happen in
          hot deserts, but exceptional weather patterns can allow sandstorms to
          sweep over non-desertic regions.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="hurricanes">
        <h1>Hurricanes</h1>
        <p>
          Cyclones, hurricanes, and typhoons design the same phenomenon, for
          different parts of the world. They are structured and large systems of
          clouds under which winds blow at more than 119 km/h (74 mph). They
          possess a zone of calm, sunny weather, called the eye, in which
          pressure is at its minimum. Winds are the strongest and most
          devastating around the eye.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hurricanes form over hot spots of water in the ocean (which must be at
          26.5 °C (80 °F) minimum; the higher, the stronger will the hurricane
          be), and also cannot form near the equator (precisely at less than 5°
          of latitude of the equator), since they must use the Coriolis' force
          to organize into a round-shape storm. They eventually either converge
          to terrestrial lands in which they cause damages but lose their
          strength, or more rarely disappears in the ocean if the water becomes
          too cold to sustain them.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="snow">
        <h1>Snow</h1>
        <p>
          Snow is atmospheric water that froze and fell to the ground, covering
          it. It happens when the temperature of the air falls at 0 °C (32 °F).
          Snow remains as long as the temperature of the ground doesn't go
          beyond 0 °C (32 °F).
        </p>
        <p>
          Snow may be appreciated by children, but it causes much worse problems
          than rain, as it makes roads impassable and walking difficult, may
          block the entrances of houses, and may even destroy cars and rooftops
          with the weight of the snow accumulated on it. Snowfalls also decrease
          visibility way worse than rain, and if accompanied by strong winds, we
          talk of blizzards. In mountains, large packs of snow may slide over
          the slope they lie in, causing an avalanche that is the deadliest
          event associated with snow. Also, snow melting can cause some floods:
          for example, a meter tall (3 feet) snow blanket melting usually turns
          into a 10 cm (4 in) puddle. Despite this, snow is important during the
          cold season as mountain stations rely on it to bring in tourists.
